<p>I work at the Centre for Consciousness Studies, NIMHANS, India.

I am an engineer turned neuroscientist. I am a mentor and builder at heart who loves technology, neuroscience in general, and non-ordinary states of consciousness in particular. I have a decade of experience in the research areas of `Working Memory`, `Neural Oscillations`, `Neuromodulation`, `Meditation Research` and `Sleep & Dreaming`. I have built communities around Edtech, productivity, blogging, and self-growth. I have taught schoolchildren and coached underprivileged people to get jobs; I have also worked as a career counselor, placement officer, and science lead for an early-stage education startup. I have a substantial amount of experience working closely with the founding team of deep neurotech startups. My expertise and interests are at the intersection of Neuroscience, Team building, Wearable technology and AI. 2025 is the year I plant one foot in academia and other foot in industry and decide if I stay that way or pull one leg (which leg) closer to the other! By the way, I am building [uMaster, India](https://www.umaster.ca/home) as head of products and tech where we are reshaping the STEM educationa and training. I am also working in Stealth mode ðŸ¥· on some cool stuff

If you are someone with a similar thought process or totally orthogonal to the above, please send an email to me at rhlvenugopal@gmail.com.

I had lots of fun, learnt a lot and made great friends at [BAMB2024](https://www.bambschool.org/), [MESEC 2024](https://mesec.co/event/workshop_2024) and [CIFAR 2024](https://cifar.ca/next-generation/cifar-neuroscience-of-consciousness-winter-school/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=soc&utm_campaign=winterschool22). I live online [here.](https://rahulvenugopal.github.io/haveyoumetrahul/)
